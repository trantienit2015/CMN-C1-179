# CMN-C1-179 — RLAnomalyDetectionAgent

> **Category**: Cat 1 (single technical capability, use-case-agnostic)
> **Industry**: CMN

## Overview

This agent watches the output of a reinforcement-learning agent and reports when its behaviour has gone wrong. Given a batch of output logs and an approved baseline, it computes the deviation of the reward distribution deterministically and classifies what it finds as policy drift, reward hacking, or behavioural collapse, then emits a structured alert report. The thresholds and the reporting format are configuration, not code, so the same capability can be pointed at different governance frameworks without changing the agent.

Detection is always deterministic. Optionally, when three Azure OpenAI secrets are configured, the agent adds a short natural-language executive summary to the report (`docs/07_operation_guide.md` §10); without them the report is identical except for that one field — never an error.

This is an agent template built with the **AGENTIC STAR** development platform and the
**AgentCore Framework**. It is intended to be taken as a starting point: fork it, adapt it to
your own data and policies, and run it inside your own AGENTIC STAR deployment.

## Requirements

**This template does not run standalone.** It requires:

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **AGENTIC STAR platform** | The agent connects to the platform at start-up. Without it, start-up fails immediately (see *Behaviour without the platform* below). Deployment guides and API documentation: [AGENTIC STAR Developers](https://developers.fd.agenticstar.tm.softbank.jp/) |
| **AgentCore Framework** (`agenticstar-agentcore`) | Installed from PyPI as a dependency. |
| Python | >=3.11 |

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Behaviour without the platform

The framework is designed to run **only** on AGENTIC STAR. There is no fallback or degraded
mode. If the platform is unreachable or the SDK version does not match, the agent raises
`PlatformRequired` during graph compile / start-up preflight rather than starting in a partially
working state. This is intentional — a half-running agent is worse than one that refuses to start.

## Quick Start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests run without a platform connection. Running the agent itself does not.

## Project Structure

```
src/          agent implementation (nodes, services, schemas)
tests/        unit, integration and boundary tests
config/       agent configuration
docs/         design and test specification
```

See `docs/02_design.md` for the design and `docs/03_test_spec.md` for the test specification.

## Customising

1. Adjust `config/` for your own environment and policies.
2. Replace the knowledge sources and sample data with your own.
3. Review the node implementations under `src/nodes/` for domain-specific logic.
4. Re-run the test suite.
